''' Consider a MxN bitmap where the cells are 0 or 1. '1' means filled and '0' means empty.

Find the number of 'holes' in the bitmap, where a hole is a contiguous region of empty cells.

For example, this has two holes:

11111  
10101  
10101  
11111  
... and this has only one:

11111  
10001  
10101  
11111 '''
